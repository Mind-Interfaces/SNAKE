1. **Set up Development Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed along with libraries like PyOpenGL and Pygame for 3D rendering and game development, respectively. You could also use more advanced tools like Unity with C# for more robust applications.

2. **Planning and Design**: Decide on design motifs, such as color schemes, textures, and 3D models. Sketch out how you envision the game interface and snake model to be.

3. **Project Structure**: 
    - Create a modular structure, separating logic, graphics, and utilities into different Python modules or classes.
    - Initialize global variables or settings.
    - Set up a main game loop that will handle rendering and user input.

4. **Initialize OpenGL Context**: 
    - Use PyOpenGL to create a 3D context where the game will be rendered.
    - Decide on camera angles and positions.

5. **Implement Snake Mechanics**: 
    - Create a class for the snake, initializing its size, position, and direction.
    - Implement a method for movement and growth.
    - Implement collision detection for the snake with boundaries and itself.

6. **Implement Food Mechanics**: 
    - Randomly generate food within the defined boundaries.
    - Detect collision between the snake and food, triggering the snake's growth.

7. **3D Graphics**: 
    - Use 3D models for the snake and food items.
    - Add textures to make it visually appealing.
    - Update positions within the OpenGL context.

8. **User Interface**: Implement score display, start menu, and endgame screen using Pygame.

9. **Event Handling**: Use Pygame to capture keypress events to control the snake's movement.

10. **Testing**: 
    - Use unit tests to check the functionality of individual methods.
    - Perform integration testing to ensure that the game runs smoothly as a whole.

11. **Documentation**: Write comments for every function, method, and important variable, adhering to PEP8 guidelines. Also, consider adding a README file to guide users and developers.

12. **Packaging and Deployment**: Package your game for the desired platforms using tools like PyInstaller for Python or appropriate methods for other platforms.
